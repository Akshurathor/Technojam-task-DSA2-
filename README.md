# Technojam-task-DSA2-
Approach-fistly i read and understand all DSA programs and then i created a suedocode of that program and after that i wrote the actual code of the progame in my laptop and run it successfully and after that save it and move to the second programe
Challenges i faced was lack of time because i am a 1st year b tech student and in b tech there are lot of assignments and ppt and also our mid terms are close so, i have to do these things also along with my classes.
